# *__General topic__* 
|  
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
Researchers have discovered how breast cancer cells can hide from immune cells to stay alive: Breast cancer cells with a lot of MAL2 (protein) on the cell surface escape immune attack. Understanding how they escape this could help improve immunotherapy.

# *__Procedure/What was examined__*
|  
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
-	Development of a computational tool to analyze data sets from more than 1,000 cancer patients thanks to the Cancer Genome Atlas.  
-	Analysis of samples
-	Discovery of MAL2 + study 

# *__Conclusions/ Discovery__*
|  
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
-	There is more MAL2 (protein) in breast cancer cells than in normal cells. 
-	Patients have a lower survival rate when the level of this protein is high in breast cancer (especially in triple negative breast cancer).
-	High levels of MAL2 increase tumor growth. 
-	Inhibition of MAL2 can stop tumor growth almost completely.
