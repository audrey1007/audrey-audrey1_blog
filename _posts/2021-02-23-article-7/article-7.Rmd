|  |  |
Researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine and Oxford University have found a way to kill some breast cancer cells that divide quickly, leaving healthy cells intact. For this, they selectively attack the core of their cell division mechanism.

# *__Procedure/What was examined__*
|  
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
-	Research on cell division mechanisms specific to cancer cells
-	Discovery of a breast cancer cell line that depends on centrioles to divide and survive.  But many cells can divide without centrioles and centrosomes.
-	Discovery: breast cancer cells grown in the laboratory cannot divide without centrioles and centrosomes. 
-	Analysis: centriole-dependent breast cancer cells have an abnormally copied section of the genome many times + study of the genes encoded in this region.
-	Discovery: a gene produces high levels of a protein (TRIM37) that controls centrosomes.
-	Addition of a drug (PLK4 inhibitor, disrupts the proteins that make centrioles) to breast cancer cells with normal levels of TRIM37 + observations. 
-	Addition of the drug to breast cancer cells with high levels of TRIM37 + observations. 

# *__Conclusions/ Discovery__*
|  
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
-	By adding the drug to breast cancer cells with normal levels of TRIM37, the cells are able to divide even without the cell's centrioles.
-	By adding the drug to breast cancer cells with high levels of TRIM37, the cells cannot longer divide and most cells stop growing and die.
