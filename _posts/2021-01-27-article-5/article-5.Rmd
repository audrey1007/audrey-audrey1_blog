Researchers at Tulane University School of Medicine identified two genes (TRAF3IP2 and Rab27a) and examined the role they play.

# *__Procedure/What was examined__*
|  
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
-	Identification of two genes (TRAF3IP2 and Rab27a)
-	Study of the role of the two genes 
-	Inhibition, deactivation of the TRAF3IP2 and Rab27a tested in mouse models that closely resemble humans
-	Rab27a silenced
-	Observations when genes stop working

# *__Conclusions/ Discovery__*
|  
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
-	TRAF3IP2 and Rab27a : role in breast cancer growth and metastasis
-	Suppression of the expression of either gene has led to a decline in tumor growth and the spread of the cancer to other organs
-	Rab27a silenced : no tumor growth but spread of a small number of cancer cells to other parts of the body
-	Deactivation of the TRAF3IP2 gene : no spread (“metastasis” or “micrometastasis”) of the original tumor cells for a full year after treatment
-	Inhibition of the TRAF3IP2 gene : arrest of future tumor growth + reduction of existing tumors to undetectable levels

The team is working on obtaining FDA approval. They hope to begin clinical trials soon.
